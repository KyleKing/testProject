This may or may not work. No promises:

1. Install Meteor ([Guide ](http://docs.meteor.com))

  ```
  curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
  ```

2. Change to the working directory

  ```
  cd testProject/
  ```

3. Run Meteor

  ```
  meteor
  ```

4. Point your browser to [Localhost:3000 ](http://localhost:3000)
